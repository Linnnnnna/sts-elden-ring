[WIP] Mod based on the elden ring game!
!!!!!!Description in github is not being updated!!!!!!

Apart from the fact that it's my first mod, it's in a very new phase of development, so maybe it's possible to find wrong texts, bugs, crashes, and many other problems.
This version is not even close to the version I want to release in the future, but it's a version to show that I'm making the mod, and in case anyone wants to help me test it, because unfortunately testing everything alone is very difficult, so stay tuned willingness to report bugs and improvements you think the mod needs!

This early version has:

<h3>26 new Relics</h3>
<ul>
  <li>7 common</li>
  <li>7 Uncommons</li>
  <li>7 Rares</li>
  <li>1 Boss</li>
  <li>4 Event Only (Shop while events have not been released)</li>
</ul>

<h3>7 new Potions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>4 common</li>
  <li>3 Uncommon</li>
</ul>

<h3>5 new encounters</h3>

<h3>1 new boss</h3>

Well, what to expect from the mod?

I really want to make a big mod, and the first definitive version will be released together with Tarnished, and probably the potions and talismans need a rework to work with the new character, and to launch him, we need a lot of new enemies, bosses , acts and events, all to get closer to the history of the Elden Ring.

So thank you so much for testing my mod!
