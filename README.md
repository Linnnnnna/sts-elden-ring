[WIP] Mod based on elden ring game!

Apart from being my first mod, this mod is in a really early development, and you may encounter mispelled texts, crashes, and a lot of bugs. This is version is for anyone who wants to help me test it, because develop and test alone is really hard, so fell free to report anything you encounter and any adjust you feel the mod need.

Early release has:

- 24 new talismans
  - 7 Common
  - 6 Uncommon
  - 7 Rare
  - 4 Event Only (Not implemented yet, i will probably put it as shop only atleast the event is implemented)
- 7 new potions
  - 4 Common
  - 3 Uncommon
- 1 new enemy(WIP)

Now, what you can expect from this mod ?

I really want to make it big, so, the first release version will be release when the [b]Tarnished[/b] will be introduced, and probably the taslismans and potions will need a remake to match this new character, but, to implement this, we need a lot of new enemies, bosses, new acts, events to match Elden Ring story, and it will be a long journey.

So, thanks for testing my mod!
